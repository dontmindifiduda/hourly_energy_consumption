# Hourly Energy Consumption
## Time Series Analysis & Forecasting

This repository includes a pair of notebooks that demonstrate basic time series analysis and forecasting techiniques using hourly energy consumption data. Forecasting techniques that were evaluated included:
* ARIMA & SARIMA
* Simple Exponential Smoothing
* Triple Exponential Smoothing (Holt-Winters)
* LSTM Neural Networks
* Prophet

The dataset used for this analysis contains hourly energy consumption data scraped from PJM Interconnection's website. A copy of the dataset can be found here:  https://www.kaggle.com/robikscube/hourly-energy-consumption

Please see the following Medium articles for a detailed description of each of the forecasting methods included in these examples:
